# RETRO MODE Session Reminders

## Retro Mode Priorities
- **Continuous improvement**: Integrate learnings into CLAUDE.md
- **PROCESS EVOLUTION**: Update modes based on what we learned
- **Review all current-*.md files**: What worked/failed, lessons, open questions
- **Rename current files**: Use format `current-*-YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md` â†’ `/logs/`

## Documentation Requirements
- **Comprehensive retrospective**: Create detailed analysis in `/memory/`
- **CLAUDE.md updates**: Add new mistake patterns and prevention strategies
- **Process improvements**: Document new workflows and checklists
- **Archive artifacts**: Move session files to appropriate locations

## Analysis Standards
- **Honest assessment**: What actually worked vs what we thought would work
- **Root cause identification**: Why did issues occur, not just what happened
- **Prevention focus**: How to avoid similar issues in future milestones
- **Process maturity**: How did our approach evolve during the milestone

## Memory Management
- **Create .md files** in `/memory/` to prevent context loss
- **Update session reminder files** based on new learnings
- **Maintain knowledge continuity** for future sessions
